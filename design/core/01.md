# Sigmal Language Specification — Part 01
# Design Goals and Philosophy

[Top](../../) &gt; [Design docs](../) &gt; [Core design](./) &gt; **Part 01**

----

## 1. Vision

Sigmal is a pure, total, compiled programming language designed to combine:

- Coq-like logical generality
- Haskell-like abstraction ergonomics
- Rust-like systems feel (without sacrificing purity/totality)
- Minimal runtime assumptions

Sigmal is not an interpreted scripting language. It is intended to compile to
low-level targets (LLVM, WASM, native) while preserving strong logical guarantees.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Totality

All programs in the core language must terminate.

- No general unbounded recursion.
- No unbounded looping constructs.
- Termination must be structurally enforced.

Totality is a foundational property, not a lint rule.

---

### 2.2 Purity

Sigmal has:

- No built-in I/O
- No ambient global world
- No implicit side effects

Effects are expressed explicitly via values (e.g., Free monads),
not as language primitives.

---

### 2.3 Simplicity

The core language:

- Minimizes syntax-level keywords
- Avoids operator precedence
- Avoids implicit semantics (no newline sensitivity)
- Prefers symbolic forms where possible

---

### 2.4 Explicitness

- No global instance registration (typeclasses are normal records).
- Modules are explicit values (records).
- Namespaces use dot (`.`) notation universally.
- `$N` is used for universe levels (`TypeN`).

---

## 3. Compilation Targets

Sigmal aims to support:

- Native (Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD)
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (freestanding)
- Other freestanding environments

A default allocator may be shipped, but no GC is assumed.
Reference counting types are allowed.

---

## 4. Standard Library Separation

Sigmal separates standard libraries into:

- `std.core` — pure logical core
- `std.low` — low-level/system glue
- `std.high` — higher-level functional/logical abstractions

Only `std.*` is reserved implicitly.

---

## 5. Relationship to WASM

WASM is a compilation target, not the language model.

Sigmal preserves stronger totality and structural guarantees than WASM alone.

---

## 6. Open Questions (Language-Level)

- Bottom / Top types inclusion
- Precise totality enforcement mechanism
- Comment syntax finalization
- Precise module/file semantics

These are tracked in later appendices.
