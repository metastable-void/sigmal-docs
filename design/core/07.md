# Sigmal Language Specification — Part 07
# Open Questions Appendix (Language-Level Consolidated)

[Top](../../) &gt; [Design docs](../) &gt; [Core design](./) &gt; **Part 07 (Appendix)**

----

This appendix consolidates all unresolved or intentionally deferred
language-level design questions discussed so far.

These are not abandoned ideas; they are open for future specification refinement.

---

## 1. Type System Open Questions

### 1.1 Bottom and Top Types

Status: Done.

Top is `Unit $u` and Bottom is `Bottom $u`.

---

### 1.2 Universe Polymorphism

Status: Done.

---

### 1.3 Formal Normalization Guarantee

- What formal core calculus will Sigmal elaborate to?
- How will normalization/termination proofs be structured?
- Will totality be syntactic or semantic (structural recursion only)?

Status: Requires formalization.

---

## 2. Syntax Open Questions

### 2.1 Comment Syntax

Requirements:

- ASCII-based
- No indentation sensitivity
- No ambiguity with core constructs
- Macro-safe

Exact syntax not yet decided.

---

### 2.2 Tuple Syntax

- Should tuples exist as primitive syntax?
- Or should all product types be explicit records?

Status: Undecided.

---

### 2.3 Surface Application Syntax

- Whether additional syntactic sugar for function application is desirable
- Whether infix operators are allowed in surface language

Core language has no operator precedence.

---

## 3. Module and Linking Open Questions

### 3.1 Import/Export Surface Syntax

- Exact syntax for importing modules
- Whether imports are purely value-level bindings

---

### 3.2 Cross-File Compilation Model

- How modules compose across compilation units
- Link-time namespace resolution guarantees

---

## 4. Abstraction and Effects Open Questions

### 4.1 Law Encoding

- Should Functor/Applicative/Monad laws be encoded in types?
- Or enforced externally?

---

### 4.2 Effect System Optimization

- Free-monad performance strategies
- Fusion or specialization passes

---

### 4.3 Do-Notation or Syntactic Sugar

- Whether to introduce surface-level monadic sugar
- How to preserve purity and totality guarantees

---

## 5. Compilation and Runtime Open Questions

### 5.1 Ownership Model

- Whether Sigmal adopts ownership/borrowing discipline
- How it interacts with totality

---

### 5.2 Stable ABI Specification

- How ABI contracts are expressed formally
- Cross-target equivalence guarantees

---

### 5.3 Deterministic Compilation

- Whether builds must be bit-for-bit reproducible
- What compiler nondeterminism is permitted

---

## 6. Long-Term Evolution Questions

- Macro system formalization
- Verified compiler ambitions
- Standard library completeness criteria
- Cross-language interop guarantees

---
