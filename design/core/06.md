# Sigmal Language Specification — Part 06
# Compilation Model, Runtime Assumptions, and Target Platforms

[Top](../../) &gt; [Design docs](../) &gt; [Core design](./) &gt; **Part 06**

----

## 1. Compilation Philosophy

Sigmal is a compiled language.

The core language is designed to:

- Elaborate to a minimal typed core calculus
- Compile to LLVM IR, native machine code, or WASM
- Require minimal runtime support
- Preserve totality guarantees at compile time

Sigmal is not an interpreted runtime-dependent language.

---

## 2. Runtime Assumptions

Sigmal makes minimal assumptions about runtime:

- No mandatory garbage collector
- Reference-counted types are permitted
- Manual or explicit allocator models are allowed
- Freestanding execution must be supported

A default allocator may be provided for convenience, including for WASM.

---

## 3. Memory Model

The memory model must support:

- Immutable data structures by default
- Efficient record layout
- Efficient inductive representation
- Predictable stack discipline (no hidden unbounded recursion)

The precise ownership/borrowing model is not yet specified.

---

## 4. Target Platforms

Primary targets include:

### Hosted Targets
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
- macOS
- Windows
- FreeBSD

### Freestanding Targets
- wasm32-unknown-unknown
- Bare-metal environments
- Kernel-level contexts

---

## 5. WASM Target Strategy

For wasm32-unknown-unknown:

- Sigmal emits a standalone WASM module
- No mandatory OS bindings
- All external interaction occurs via explicit capability injection

A sane default allocator should be provided.

---

## 6. ABI Considerations

Each target must define:

- Calling convention
- Record layout strategy
- Inductive representation strategy
- Export/import model

These are target-specific but must preserve semantic equivalence.

---

## 7. No Implicit World

Even in hosted environments:

- No implicit I/O model
- No hidden runtime world parameter
- Effects must be expressed explicitly via values

---

## 8. Open Questions (Compilation & Runtime)

- Precise ownership model
- Cross-module linking semantics
- Stable ABI specification format
- Deterministic compilation guarantees
- Optimization passes respecting totality proofs
