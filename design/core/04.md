# Sigmal Language Specification — Part 04
# Surface Syntax and Core Syntax Constraints

[Top](../../) &gt; [Design docs](../) &gt; [Core design](./) &gt; **Part 04**

----

## 1. Core Syntax Philosophy

The core syntax of Sigmal follows strict constraints:

- No indentation sensitivity
- Newlines are whitespace only
- No implicit separators
- No operator precedence in the core language
- Minimal alphanumeric keywords
- Preference for ASCII symbolic constructs
- Fully deterministic parsing

The core language must be unambiguous and macro-friendly.

---

## 2. No Operator Precedence

The core language defines no operator precedence rules.

All applications and constructs must be explicitly structured.

This avoids parsing ambiguity and simplifies macro systems.

---

## 3. Function Application and Currying

Sigmal favors currying-safe syntax.

Core function form:

    fn (A : $0) (x : A) { ... }

Function application is left-associative at the AST level but must be explicitly structured in surface syntax.

No implicit argument grouping via precedence.

---

## 4. Symbolic Core Constructs

Core constructs are symbolic:

- `&{ ... }` — record
- `# { ... }` — inductive
- `$N` — universe level
- `:` — typing
- `.` — projection / qualification

Alphanumeric keywords are minimized.

---

## 5. Blocks vs Records

Records use:

    &{ ... }

Blocks use:

    { ... }

This distinction ensures deterministic parsing between:

- Code blocks
- Record values

`&` always indicates a record type/value context.

---

## 6. Comments

Comment syntax remains open.

Requirements:

- Must not introduce parsing ambiguity
- Must not depend on indentation
- Should be ASCII-based

Final comment form to be specified.

---

## 7. Future Macro Support

The syntax must allow:

- Programs that operate on module-record values
- First-class modules
- Hygienic macro expansion

No implicit grammar tricks should prevent macro introduction later.

---

## 8. Open Questions (Syntax)

- Final comment syntax
- Exact application surface form
- Optional tuple syntax
- Exact grammar specification
