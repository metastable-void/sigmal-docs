# Sigmal Language Specification — Part 03
# Modules, Namespaces, and Module Semantics

[Top](../../) &gt; [Design docs](../) &gt; [Core design](./) &gt; **Part 03**

---

Sigmal does not have a distinct nominal module system.

Instead:

* A source file evaluates to a value.
* Modules are ordinary record values.
* Projection (`.`) is the only mechanism for namespace access.
* There is no global namespace.
* There is no implicit export mechanism.

All module behavior is defined in terms of records and projection.

---

## 1. Compilation Units

A source code unit is a compilation unit (it need not correspond to a filesystem file).

A compilation unit consists of:

* Zero or more top-level definitions (each ending with `;`)
* A final expression (without a trailing `;`)

The value of the compilation unit is the value of its final expression.

Example:

```sigmal
helper =
  \ (x : Nat) -> Nat = + x 1;

&{
  public = helper;
}
```

The module’s value is the final record.

If the final expression is not a record, the compilation unit still evaluates to a value, but it is not usable as a namespace via projection.

There is no implicit _record_ wrapping of top-level bindings; only the final expression determines the exported value.

If the compilation unit ends with a trailing `;`, its final value is `Unit`.

---

## 2. Exports

There is no separate export declaration mechanism.

The exported interface of a compilation unit is determined entirely by its final value.

If the final value is a record:

* Its symbol-keyed fields constitute the exported namespace.

If the final value is not a record:

* The compilation unit exports that value directly.

Bindings that appear before the final expression are local unless included in the final value.

Example:

```sigmal
private =
  \ (x : Nat) -> Nat = x;

&{
  public = private;
}
```

Only `public` is exported.

---

## 3. Modules as Records

A module usable as a namespace must evaluate to a record value.

Example:

```sigmal
&{
  add =
    \ (x : Nat)
      (y : Nat)
    -> Nat
    = + x y;
}
```

After importing:

```sigmal
math = .math;
math.add 1 2
```

Projection works because `math` is a record.

---

## 4. Non-Record Compilation Units

A compilation unit may evaluate to any value.

Example (function-valued unit):

```sigmal
\ (x : Nat) -> Nat = + x 1
```

After import:

```sigmal
inc = .inc;
inc 41
```

Attempting:

```sigmal
inc.foo
```

is a type error, since `inc` is not a record.

Example (type-valued unit):

```sigmal
Nat
```

After import:

```sigmal
MyNat = .MyNat;
```

`MyNat` is a value of a universe.

---

## 5. Projection

The operator `.` is record projection.

For any record value `r`:

```sigmal
r.k
```

is sugar for:

```sigmal
r.@{ TextSym "k" }
```

Projection is left-associative:

```sigmal
a.b.c
```

means:

```sigmal
(a.b).c
```

There is no alternate meaning of `.` in import statements.

---

## 6. Symbol-Keyed Projection

Projection keys are symbols.

Identifiers in projection position are sugar for symbol injection.

```sigmal
r.@{ TextSym "k" }
```

Explicit symbol injection is allowed:

```sigmal
r.@{ someConstSym }
```

where `someConstSym` must be const-normalizable.

Runtime `Sym` values cannot determine projection keys.

---

## 7. Import

Import introduces a local binding to the value of another compilation unit.

Surface form:

```sigmal
alloc = .std.alloc;
```

Bare `.` in projection position denotes the top-level module record provided by the resolver.

Import is syntactic sugar for binding a projected value.

Import does not change the meaning of `.`.

---

## 8. The Top-Level Module Value

Compilation occurs relative to a distinguished top-level record value supplied by the resolver.

Bare `.` in projection position refers to this value.

Example:

```sigmal
.std.alloc
```

means:

Project the field `std` from the top-level module record, then project `alloc`.

The core language does not define how this record is constructed.

---

## 9. Resolver Independence

Module resolution is external to the core language.

The resolver provides:

* A deterministic top-level module record
* Constructed from compilation units

Possible resolver strategies include:

* Filesystem-based resolution
* Database-backed resolution
* Embedded modules
* Generated modules
* Network-based resolution

For a fixed resolver configuration, resolution must be deterministic.

The core type system makes no assumptions about storage or linking mechanisms.

The resolver-provided top-level record includes standardized `.std.*` modules (see [Part 01](01.html)).

---

## 10. Structural Equality of Modules

Modules are record values.

Two modules are definitionally equal if:

* They contain identical symbol keys
* Corresponding field values are definitionally equal

There is no nominal module identity.

---

## 11. Re-Exporting

Re-exporting is ordinary record construction.

Example:

```sigmal
&{
  add = .std.math.add;
}
```

Only explicitly included fields are exported.

There is no implicit re-export.

---

## 12. No Global Namespace

Sigmal defines no global namespace.

Only values reachable through:

* The top-level module record
* Explicit import bindings
* Explicit lexical bindings

exist in scope.

There is no global registry of modules, instances, or properties.

---

## 13. Interaction with Const and Symbols

Symbol injection may be used in projection:

```sigmal
.@{ TextSym "std" }.@{ someConstSym }
```

Each injected symbol must be const-normalizable.

Projection is always structural record access.

There is no dynamic path resolution at runtime.

> NOTE: `TextSym` (and related symbol construction utilities) are provided by `.std.core`. (See [Part 04](04.html))

---

## 14. Summary

In Sigmal:

* A compilation unit evaluates to a value.
* If that value is a record, it may serve as a namespace.
* Exports are exactly the fields of the final record value.
* Projection is the only namespace mechanism.
* Import is syntactic sugar for projection from the top-level module record.
* The resolver supplies the top-level record.
* There is no nominal module identity.
* There is no implicit linking or global namespace.

Modules are fully integrated into the core language as ordinary values.
