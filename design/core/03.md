# Sigmal Language Specification — Part 03
# Modules, Namespaces, and Module Semantics

[Top](../../) &gt; [Design docs](../) &gt; [Core design](./) &gt; **Part 03**

----

## 1. Namespace Philosophy

Sigmal has no implicit global namespace.

- Only `std.*` is reserved implicitly.
- All other namespaces must be introduced explicitly.
- Dot (`.`) is used uniformly for:
  - Module paths
  - Field projection
  - Constructor qualification

There is no `::` operator. `:` is reserved for typing.

---

## 2. Modules Are Records

A module in Sigmal is a record value.

Conceptually:

    MyModule = &{
      x = 10;
      y = 20;
    };

This means:

- A module is a value.
- Fields are definitions.
- Modules compose via record composition.

There is no special “module scope” separate from values.

---

## 3. File-Level Semantics

A source file must elaborate to a record value.

That is, the top-level form of a file must evaluate to `&{ ... }`.

This preserves the invariant:

    Every module is a record.

General expressions at the file root are not allowed unless wrapped
in a record.

---

## 4. First-Class Modules

Because modules are records:

- Modules are first-class values.
- Modules can be passed as arguments.
- Modules can be returned from functions.
- Macros can operate on modules as ordinary data.

This enables metaprogramming without introducing a separate macro language.

---

## 5. Field Resolution

Given:

    M = &{
      x = 1;
    };

Field access:

    M.x

Dot resolution applies uniformly across:

- Modules
- Records
- Namespaces
- Type constructors

---

## 6. Standard Library Namespaces

Reserved namespaces:

- `std.core`
- `std.low`
- `std.high`

No other namespace is implicitly present.

---

## 7. No Global Instance Registration

Because modules and typeclasses are values:

- There is no global instance resolution mechanism.
- No coherence issues from overlapping instances.
- All dictionary passing is explicit.

---

## 8. Open Questions (Modules)

- Exact module import/export surface syntax
- Macro system design
- Cross-file compilation model
- Link-time namespace resolution guarantees
