# 🌐 **Sigmal**

### The small language with big guarantees

Sigmal is a modern programming language built on a tiny, symbolic, and mathematically sound core.
Every Sigmal program is **total**, **pure**, and **deterministic** — yet expressive enough to build real software, compilers, and safe metaprogramming systems.

Sigmal aims to bridge **logic** and **engineering**, offering a foundation strong enough for proofs and practical enough for everyday code.
